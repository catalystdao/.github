## Cross-chain Liquidity Layer for Modular Chains

Catalyst is the permissionless liquidity layer for the modular future. Any new modular chain can use Catalyst to permissionlessly connect liquidity and swap with hubs like Ethereum and Cosmos.

Modular blockchains – a relatively new concept in crypto – are blockchains that are made up of different modules that can be added or removed as needed. Each module performs a specific function, making the blockchain more flexible and adaptable to changing needs, allowing for greater customization and specialization. Modular blockchains can help increase the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks, allowing more people to begin to adopt and use crypto technology.

Modular blockchains are easier to configure and deploy than traditional blockchains, enabling an explosion of different blockchains. While new chains continue to launch, they remain siloed and fragmented, which in turn hinders trade between them. Catalyst is changing this, dissolving the barriers between chains as a global liquidity layer.

## Get Involved

If you'd like to learn more about how Catalyst works as an open-source protocol, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/catalystamm) to keep up-to-date on our roadmap, and visit our [documentation](https://docs.catalyst.exchange/) page for a high-level overview.

We're also hiring! Cata Labs is the core contributor to Catalyst, and is a software development company that builds developer tooling to make it easier for blockchain companies to create new blockchains and connect them together. Cata Labs is a remote, international team with a wide range of diverse experiences, languages, cultures, nationalities and backgrounds. See our [job postings](https://catalabs.notion.site/Join-Cata-Labs-Building-Catalyst-0959a322184e44a9babce8bfe25209b7) for open roles, and if you don't see one that fits your background and goals, reach out to us on Twitter with a proposal.
